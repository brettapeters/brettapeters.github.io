I made this little bingo game based on HGTV's Fixer Upper show as a fun way to practice React and a found it was good use case for Local Storage. I originally found a similar bingo game online, but grew frustrated with it when the game board refreshed every time I reopened the browser on my phone. This prompted me to rebuild my own version using Local Storage so that a player wouldn't lose their game if they closed their browser or accidentally refreshed the page.


In the future it might be a fun project to add a realtime multiplayer feature which would involve adding a server-side component.
