This was my first web app that I made from scratch. It was an exercise a part of a tutorial series called [Level Up Rails](https://leveluprails.com/) that teaches Ruby/Rails as well as software design and practical skills. I struggled immensely coming up with a clean way to design the app, which taught me a lot about managing dependencies, modularizing code, and refactoring. I am still proud to look back at this project because it was the moment for me where the training wheels came off for the first time.
