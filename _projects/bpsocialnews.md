I wanted to use React as the UI layer for a Meteor app, so this project was born. It is basically a HackerNews-style social news aggregator that allows users to share, upvote, downvote, and comment on links. The main challenge was figuring out how to get realtime data from the Meteor server to play nicely with the React frontend. After a lot of trial and error, I got the app to work, and learned all about how to get data into a React app along the way.
