I made this site as an info page for a Wedding. It was definitely a learning experience in project organization and time-management. The end result is packed full of bells and whistles including parallax, SVG animation, smooth scrolling, Google Maps integration, a song request feature, and more.


While I wouldn't dare cram so many flashy bits into one page ever again, it was fun and challenging to make this site. The song request feature turned out to be a hit, which made the effort worth it.
