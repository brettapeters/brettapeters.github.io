I created this project to get some practice with React, Redux, and App Engine. It consists of two main pieces - a JSON REST API and a React/Redux single-page app. Fortunately App Engine provides very easy-to-use tools to achieve this setup.

I hadn't done much with Redux before, which I think is important to at least have a basic understanding of as a React developer. It took me some time to sort out integrating Redux with React Router v4 and also to learn Redux code organization patterns, but in the end the project deepened my understanding of Redux. It became clear that the advantages of Redux do not lend much to this small of a project, but I now know its pros and cons.
